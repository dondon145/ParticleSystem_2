This particle system works alright and has an emitter. 
It does not have any premade particle effects other than some weird water splashes.

I did not do any heavy changes in past 1-2 weeks, and the code looks mess to me right now, so I will leave this project like this.
When I decide to toy around with particles again, I will create other version from scratch.
