This particle system works decent and has an emitter. 
It does not have any premade particle effects other than some weird water splashes.

The emitter throws out all available particles at an instant. 
So the emitter class needs some fixing, to have effects other than splashes.

I did not do any heavy changes in past 1-2 weeks, and the code looks mess to me right now, so I will leave this project like this.
When I decide to toy around with particles again, I will create other version from scratch.
